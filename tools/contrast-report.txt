Contrast notes (quick manual check):

Primary red: #d62828
White: #ffffff
Black background: #070707

Contrast ratios (approx):
- #d62828 on #070707 -> ~6.5:1 (satisfies WCAG AA and AAA for large text)
- #ffffff on #070707 -> ~21:1 (excellent)
- #d62828 on #ffffff -> ~4.3:1 (passes AA for large text, may fail AAA for small text)

Recommendations:
- Use white text on dark backgrounds for body text.
- Use primary red for accents and large headings. For small red text on white, darken red slightly (#b71c1c) to improve small-text contrast.
- Consider providing a high-contrast toggle that switches accent colors for improved readability.
